Ion Site Builder is a tool for building simple websites.

## Notes

1. To save as HTML, click "Export" at the bottom of the app.
2. If you want to edit the HTML, just edit the text in the code.
3. The preview button needs Google Chrome to work.
4. The site that gets generated is not mobile friendly.

It's very easy to use! Here's a screenshot:
